= FCode Tools

FCode Tools is a (slowly growing) collection of tools for working with Sun
Microsystems OpenBoot firmware (FCode).  The primary development platforms are
Solaris 7 and NetBSD 10, with periodic testing on a current Linux system.


Installing the Binary Package
-----------------------------
I currently only provide a binary package for Solaris 7:
https://github.com/mdehling/fcode-tools/raw/main/pkg/MDXfcode-v0.2-sparc.pkg[MDXfcode-v0.2-sparc.pkg].
It can be installed using the `pkgadd` command.  By default, this will install
the package in `/opt/MDXfcode`.  You will probably want to add
`/opt/MDXfcode/bin` to your `PATH` variable.

Installing from Source
----------------------
To compile, simply run `make` in the repositories root directory.  This will
compile the sources and run some regression tests.  Before doing this,
however, take a moment to check the `pass:[src/Makefile.`uname`]` file for
your system.  On a reasonably modern system you should only have to set the
`CC` variable to your preferred C compiler.

To compile on older systems, you may need to make additional changes (have a
look at `src/Makefile.SunOS`.)  Currently you will need, at a minimum, a
working `vsnprintf` implementation.  The earliest version of Solaris to
provide one is Solaris 2.6.

If you manage to compile the sources, you will be left with a binary named
`fcode` in the `src` directory.  Simply place it somewhere in your path, e.g.,
in `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/bin`.


Usage
-----
Running the `fcode` executable will print the following usage instructions:

----
usage:
	fcode [-h|-v]
	fcode detokenize [-2|-3] [-o <output.fth>] input.fcode
	fcode extract [-o <output.fcode>] input.bin
----

Running `fcode -v` prints version information, `fcode -h` or any invalid
option will again print the above usage instructions.

The `fcode detokenize` command reads FCode from the specified input file and
writes the detokenized output Forth code to the output file (if specified) or
to the standard output.  The options `-2` and `-3` select which FCode version
to treat the input as.  The default is version 2.

The `fcode extract` command tries to locate FCode inside the specified input
binary file.  The output will be written to the specified file or, if none is
given, to a file in the current directory with the same name as the input file
but with an extension of `.fcode`.

An FCode tokenizer is a work in progress and I hope to add it soon.  At least
on Solaris you can use Sun's own FCode tokenizer until then.  It is available
https://archive.org/details/sun-ddk-v2.6[here] on the internet archive.  Don't
use Sun's detokenizer, though.  It has some very annoying bugs, which is the
reason I wrote my own in the first place.
